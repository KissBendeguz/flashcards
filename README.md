# Flashcards

Basic web application for learning purposes written in Angular.


## How does it work

It is basicly a website where you can create learning cards, by providing a question and a list of correct answers. 
As you finish creating all your cards with the desired questions you can start a session with a selected group of cards. The site is going to pop up the cards randomly so you can excercise and memorize the answers.
